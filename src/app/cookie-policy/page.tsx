      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">UK/EU Compliant Cookie Policy for Your Website</h1>
      <p>Last Updated: 18 July 2025</p>

      <p>This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>

      <p>This policy is intended to be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy, which provides more detailed information about how we process your personal data.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>

      <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, us) are called &quot;first-party cookies&quot;. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called &quot;third-party cookies&quot;. Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., like advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our website to operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our online properties. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">The types of cookies we use</h2>
      <p>We use several categories of cookies on our website. Below is a detailed summary of the types of cookies we use and their purposes.</p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
      <p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the website to you, you cannot refuse them. We use first-party cookies from [Your Website Name] for purposes such as user authentication and session management. For example, a cookie keeps you logged in as you navigate through our site. These typically last for the duration of your session.</p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
      <p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our website for you to enhance your experience.</p>

      <p>For example, we use Google Analytics, a third-party service from Google LLC, to analyse our website traffic and user behaviour. The data collected is aggregated and anonymised to help us improve our website. These cookies can last for up to 2 years. You can find more information in the Google Analytics Privacy Policy and can opt-out by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. We may also use services like Hotjar from Hotjar Ltd., which helps us understand our users&apos; experience (e.g., time spent on pages, links clicked) to optimise our service. These cookies typically last up to 365 days. You can find a Hotjar opt-out link on their compliance page. You can manage your preferences for these non-essential cookies through our Cookie Consent Manager.</p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Functionality Cookies</h3>
      <p>These cookies are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalise our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). We may use first-party cookies from [Your Website Name] to remember your settings, which provide a more personalised experience. These are persistent cookies that can last for up to one year. You can manage your preferences for these cookies through our Cookie Consent Manager.</p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Advertising and Targeting Cookies</h3>
      <p>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and selecting advertisements based on your interests.</p>

      <p>We use services like Google Ads/DoubleClick (from Google LLC) to deliver targeted advertisements to individuals who visit our website and measure campaign effectiveness. These cookies can last up to 18 months. You can opt-out of personalised advertising by visiting Google&apos;s Ads Settings. We also use the Facebook/Meta Pixel (from Meta Platforms, Inc.) to measure, optimise, and build audiences for our advertising campaigns. These cookies can last up to 180 days. You can opt-out of ad targeting via the DAA or EDAA&apos;s consumer choice portals. You can manage your preferences for these cookies through our Cookie Consent Manager.</p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Social Media Cookies</h3>
      <p>These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we may have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests, which may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. These cookies are set by platforms such as Twitter or LinkedIn when you interact with sharing buttons or embedded content. The providers and durations vary, and you should refer to the privacy policies of the respective platforms for information on how to manage their cookies. You can manage your preferences for these cookies through our Cookie Consent Manager.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">How can you control cookies?</h2>
      <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in our Cookie Consent Manager. Our Cookie Consent Manager can be found on our website&apos;s cookie banner and is also accessible at any time through a persistent link in our website footer.</p>

      <p>The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Strictly necessary cookies cannot be rejected as they are essential to provide you with services.</p>

      <p>You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser&apos;s help menu for more information.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Your rights in respect of your personal data</h2>
      <p>Where the cookies we use process your personal data, you have certain rights under data protection law. These rights are explained in more detail in our Privacy Policy. In summary, your rights include the right to access, rectify, erase, and restrict the processing of your personal data. You also have the right to data portability and the right to object to processing.</p>

      <p>To exercise any of your rights, please contact us using the details provided below.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Changes to this Cookie Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>
